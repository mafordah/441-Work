## My Experience
In learning AJAX this evening I felt very confident going into it. I read through the examples and watched all of the videos and was feeling very good about integrating AJAX and jQuery together. I was even able to run a test with the example dataset that worked perfectly. However, when I got into the big data, things started to fall apart.

## Problems
The first issue I ran into was that the newest version of Firefox wasn't able to bring up any datasets. I was able to do it in Microsoft's Edge so that problem was fixed very quickly.

The one and only giant problem I had was dealing with all of the data. I couldn't quite figure out why what I was doing would work with the example data but would come back undefined as plugged in the outside data. I found out through about three hours of trial and error (and a few stress tears) that because the data was in an array, I would have to declare the index when call the information. Once I had that set aside, I was able to apply and style the data to look something like an in-game Pokedex. I didn't get as fancy with the jQuery plugin as I would have liked, but I'm working on time management with the new switch to all online classes. Hopefully this at least shows that I have an idea of what's going on for the most part.
