## My Experience
For this project I had a few issues getting the GLTF loader working which you gladly fixed for me. I had a small syntax error. I ended up using a GLB file from with in the example because for some reason my GLB from Windows Paint 3D had some issues loading. Once I got this settled, I really just had to sit down and find some time to figure out the coordinates that everything needed to be in. The flamingo was so big that my cubes were in side of it. I had to do some moving around to get it all figured out. I also figures out how to place the objects in the 3D space. For the mouse movement, I wanted to map the speed of the rotation to the mouse. I couldn't find a reference for whatever reason so I use the `clientX` and `clientY` functions. I accidently but them in the function for the camera position instead of the rotation, but I ended up really liking the way it turned out.
