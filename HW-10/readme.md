## My Experience
  This week I had an interesting time experimenting with HTML5. It feels just like p5.js! With this project I created moving and movable objects that interact with out another. This also triggers the background color to change.

## Problems
  I had some issues with collisions and ended up using and external source for reference on collision logic. I believe I had some variables swapped, but I also ended up using `&&` as apposed to `||` as suggested. I also had some issues with getting the background to fade when changing instead of flashing. Lastly, I had to find a way to get the music to play without using autoplay as it's not supported by Chrome. I ended up triggering it with  a key press. Other than this, I really just had fun exploring all of the different things I could to with the shapes. Excited for more!
