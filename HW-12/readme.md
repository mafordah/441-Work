## My Experience
Phaser is such a fun tool! I had a great time playing around with the physics on all the objects. Made me laugh quite a few times. I had a pretty smooth ride for this project. Though I didn't do anything very fancy, I am excited about how I was able to implement a Mario-style "star power" function. Though in this case it's "orb power" like in Smash Brothers. It increases the players velocity and allows them to collect bombs (for 10x the points) for 8 seconds. I also was able to give each star it's own gravity, add another platform, and make the character jump with space. I thought able changing the player sprite too, but I couldn't for the life of me find another actual sprite sheet in the Phaser GitHub assets folder. I probably wasn't looking in the right place.
