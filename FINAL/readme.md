# Final Projeck
## My Experience
For this project I had an great time trying my hand at story telling. I did end up going a little over board on the options for some of the routes and lost time on the others. There are however 2 fully completed routes. The route of the "bright one" (entered by clicking "someone brilliant") and "rogue one" (entered by clicking "someone brash") are complete finished with several different endings and item events. Will definitely be finishing all of the routes and endings as we move into the summer (I might even have a few more by the time this is graded). But for the record, I did only have those two done at the time this was turned in.

Once I got all of the JavaScript and jQuery built, I really just had a lot of fun putting together the story. I improved off of my original story a bit (hence why I ran a bit behind), but I'm much happier with what I have now. I even was able to get a little art in there.

## Problems
Asside from the constant of having to double and triple check my JSON for errors. One of the biggest problems I had with this project was getting the continue arrow to work. As you saw, it was a bit of a mind-bender as to what it was doing and why. After fiddling with it for a few days (something about the continue button with the arrows really bugged me) I was able to save it with my pride and joy, CSS.

Another large struggle I had was getting the inventory to work. Because I was working with both the array in JSON and my JavaScript array, it took me a good moment to realize they needed to be nested for the selection to work. In the end, I was able to get it all working and get the story in there.


## Going forward
Of all the things I did, I still wish I would have giving myself not only enough time to finish the JSON, but also to build a menu and implement local storage. I also would have liked to get more art from the characters and even some sound. I have some amature voice actors who are willing to participate in the future. I can definitely see myself taking this project much further than I did in the coming months and into the future. After all, what better things do I have to do right now ;).
