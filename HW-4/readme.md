## My Experience
JavaScript is getting so much easier! Though my `if` and `if else` statements are getting a little complex for comfort. I feel confident that I, at the very least, know what is going on now. I was able to implement most of the new things we learned this week. Including `Math.random()` which I used to randomize an event for one of the characters. While I technically "included" a `while` loop, I couldn't come up with anything to actually use it for yet. I will need it to create menus in future iterations, but for now it's just looping a number. I was going to use it to slowly change the "Darkness" in the scene where the characters wake up, but as the number called it didn't update the visual properly. Maybe I'm just missing a `for` loop again, who knows ;).

## Problems
The main problem I faced with this project is getting thing to show up and disappear when I needed them too. I learned a very important lesson that if you call a style directly in the DOM, it will not override in the script. Or at the very least, it didn't work for me. Once I switched to hiding it initially in the script, my problems were solved. It did not, however stop my problem of haphazardly forgetting to hide and unhide things. Had to run through the story a few times to make sure I had it all sorted out. I think it's good now.


## Continuing Onward
I have officially decided that I will continue this story as my final project. I'm enjoying building the story too much to want to start something else now. I outline what I plan on adding to this project in my Final Project Outline, so I won't repeat too much here.
