# HW-1
## My Experience
For this assignment I found myself completely relearning CSS. While I have remembered (for the most part) HTML due to using it now and again to style text, I had pretty much completely forgotten everything about CSS from a year ago. After a review of some of the code from the example and some extensive googling of formats, I finally had a site that looked half-way decent. The most notable difference I found was that I was a bit more sloppy while coding CSS than I remembered it looking in some of my older sites.

## Something New
The completely new subjects I ran into were Mobile-First web design which I think remember briefly covering optionally in Web Design, and breaks which I hadn't heard of until now. I definitely found myself in the sample code the most for this. I read the recommended reading, but it didn't go into much detail on how to accomplish it. I ended up using the dimensions as presented in the example, assuming they are some sort of standard, and adjusted the title font size to those. I was going to do the same with my self portrait (an old graphic design project from my Sophomore year of High School), but I was able to get it to resize to the screen width instead.

## Problems
My most significant problem was getting my text to wrap around my portrait. I ended up using
`overflow: hidden;`
along with some additional margins and padding and **finally** got it to work.

Overall, I had a very refreshing experience in HTML again and can't wait to add more to my coding knowledge.
