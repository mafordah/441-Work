## My Experience
This week we worked on jQuery, another new subject for me. I had some struggles getting the hang of it, but ultimately have a working piece. The actual jQuery syntax and logic was pretty similar and easy enough to pick up. I did however struggle in the integration with HTML and JavaScript (the CSS was okay though).

## Problems
The first problem I ran into was getting the jQuery function to loop infinitely. As it turns out, I just had the functions in the wrong order (jQuery inside of JavaScript instead of JavaScript inside of jQuery). Once I have that figured out (several hour later...) I was able to get the rest working fairly quickly, with my main issues being logical errors on my part. The only one I wasn't able to quite work out was getting the moving elements to loop properly. I think it may have something to do with looping everything at once, but I can't seem to work out why. I also ran into a few HTML syntax errors this time around. I forgot to close my `<span>` tag and was changing all of my text instead of the one word. I also had all of my array elements in a single string on accident. Other than this, things went fairly smooth!
