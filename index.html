        From traditional art to the ever-evolving media, Miya has always found herself happily
        surrounded by the art world. Finding a passion for graphic design at age 13, she has never
        looked back. After completing a year of graphic design for a winter apparel company, Miya
        has continued exploring new media. This website was built to showcase her work for the
        University of Montana's MART441 Web Technology class. It will feature her various live sites
        for the course.

        Miya is a dedicated designer who has chosen to keep fresh eyes by continuing to learn. With new technology
        developed everyday, she finds it important to never stop exploring tactics, new and old, to bring something
        different to the projects she takes part in.

        Miya is a Junior at the University of Montana studying Media Arts with a focus on digital media. While she is unsure where
        Media Arts will take her, she is certain that she will continue to explore even after she's found her calling. She is currently
        drawn to animation, interactive media, and game design. She also enjoys editing home videos and figure skating in her spare time.
